Project
<hr>

You met a developer at last week's meet-up and followed up with her via email. Her company isn't hiring at the moment, but she's volunteering on the side at an educational non-profit that needs help building a learning website for kids. The project is unpaid but it's a worthwhile cause, a chance to make connections, and an opportunity to build your portfolio further.

The concept for the website is to make learning fun: children will write up a list of words they don't know (but would like to learn) and then come up with their own definitions. Once you complete the basic objectives, you have an additional challenge: make this the best website for kids you can!

The Word Definer
Make an application that contains a Word class. The homepage of the app should list all words. When a word is clicked, it should lead to a page with the word's definitions. Children should be able to add a word, and when viewing a word, be able to add, update or delete one or more definitions. This week you should deploy your application to Heroku so the kids can try it out!

Objectives
<hr>

Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

Basic objectives are in place (see below).
Full CRUD functionality for both Words and Definitions.
Routes are named using RESTful conventions.
Sinatra application uses views, instance variables and forms.
Sinatra routes process GET and POST requests/responses.
Project includes thorough and passing integration specs.
Application is deployed to Heroku (Include the link in your README).
Project demonstrates a thorough understanding of this weeks concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your with an instructor using correct terminology.
Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
Required functionality was present by the end of class on Friday.
Last Week's Objectives
For reference, here are the required basic objectives:

Objects are created from a custom class with custom methods.
Specs have complete coverage for the behaviors that need to be tested.
All specs are passing.
Logic is easy to understand.
Code has proper indentation and spacing.
Variable names are descriptive.
Good Git documentation (regular commits with clear, consistently formatted messages and complete README).
Message syntax should complete the sentence "This commit will..."; for example "update image files on the home page".
README should include application name, author name, description, setup instructions, licensing.
Further Exploration
If you complete the primary objectives and functionality with time to spare, consider adding the following additional features:

Make the site kid-friendly! It's up to you to decide what that means.
Add a property to each Word that allows kids to link a picture.
Allow kids to sort Words alphabetically.
Allow kids to search for a particular Word in your application.
Include a page where kids can view all Words and their corresponding Definitions in one list.
Include a randomizer method where kids can click a button and randomly look at a Word.
